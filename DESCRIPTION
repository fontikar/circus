Description: circus is a package for wrangling and summarising 'brmsfit' mixed model objects. 
                The package allows quick calculations of intra-class correlations (ICC) coefficients
                such as heritability from quantitative genetics models (animal models). 
                This package is still under development and currently supports random intercept models only. 
                See README and vignette('circus') for further information.
