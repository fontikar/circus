\title{Get intra-class correlation}
\usage{
get_icc(model, var)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object of class "brmsfit". Model must contains at least one random effect in order to computer an ICC value}

\item{var}{A character string that matches a random effect parameter in the model for which ICC is computed for.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the variable (var) which ICC is computed for, the posterior mean (Estimate) of ICC value, the standard deviation of the posterior distribution (Est.Error) and the two-sided 95% credible intervals (based on quantiles).
}
\description{
Computes the intra-class coefficient from a "brmsfit" model object using the entire posterior distribution
}
\examples{
#Fit an animal model to estimate heritability of birth weight
fit1 <- brm(
BWT ~  1 + (1|ANIMAL) + (1|MOTHER), data = gryphon,
family = gaussian(), cov = list(ANIMAL = A),
chains = 1, cores = 2, iter = 100)

#Computes ICC for "ANIMAL", this representsthe proportion of variance explained by additive genetic variation among individuals (i.e. heritability)
get_icc(model = fit1, var = "ANIMAL")

Computes ICC for "MOTHER", this is the proportion of variance explained by maternal identity (i.e maternal effects)
get_icc(model = fit1, var = "MOTHER")
